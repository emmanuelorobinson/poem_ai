You are the sun that shines brightly throughout my day.
You are the gravity that holds me down in every way.
You are the moon that shimmers throughout my night.
You are stars that glimmer oh so bright.

You are the oxygen that keeps me alive.
You are my heart that beats inside.
You are the blood that flows through me.
You are the only guy I can see.
You have the voice of when a mockingbird sings.
You are my everything.

You are my one and only.
You stop me from being so lonely.
We plan our future as if we have a clue.
I never want to lose you.
I want you to be my husband, and I want to be your wife.
I want to be with you for the rest of my life.


A million stars up in the sky.
One shines brighter - I can't deny.
A love so precious, a love so true,
a love that comes from me to you.
The angels sing when you are near.
Within your arms I have nothing to fear.
You always know just what to say.
Just talking to you makes my day.
I love you, honey, with all of my heart.
Together forever and never to part.


Would it be ok if I took some of your time?
Would it be ok if I wrote you a rhyme?

Would it be ok if I opened my heart?
Would it be ok if I took on the part

Of being your man and showed you a view,
One that only a real man could do?

Would it be ok if I could make you smile?
Would it be ok if I held you awhile?

Would it be ok if I kissed your face?
Would it be ok if I were to replace

All the men in your past that just wouldn't do
And vow to be faithful and always be true?

Would it be alright to look in your eyes?
Would it be alright to never tell lies?

Would it be alright to find a way?
Would it be alright to long for the day

To pull you close and whisper in your ear
And tell you our feelings are nothing to fear?

Would it be ok if I took some of your time?
Would it be ok if I wrote you a rhyme?

To tell you there's nothing I'd rather do
Than spend my whole life loving only you...
